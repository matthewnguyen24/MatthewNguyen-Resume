        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Matthew Nguyen and I am a student at University of California, Riverside. Some of my favorite hobbies are playing videogames, basketball. and hanging out. <br><br>

        I know how to work with computers and do techonological things such as creating spreadsheets and forms with Microsoft Office. <br><br>

        Being a business major, I am always looking to communicate with others and work with people to solve common problems. I am hard working and doing my best in school to be as successful as I can. My dream job is to sell homes and start up my own cafe! There I would sell some of my favorite bakery products such as croissants and sandwiches. I would also like to sell my favorite drink which is boba!  I really want to start a cafe as cafes are seen as very peaceful and relaxing to be around. Playing soft music and sitting back sounds like a good time to me. Speaking of music, I learned to play the piano when I was younger and have played the piano for 14 long years.  At the cafe, I would also like to sell small snacks and chips. It would be some of my favorite snacks such as lays chile limon which is the best flavor of lays. Selling homes, which is my other dream job, is something I want to do as looking at different homes is really fun. Being able to look at property and admiring it is something that I dream of. Also, my mother loves to look at homes too so I would take her around when I go to work. She would love to look at homes with me and sell them. Selling homes highly relies on communication and I love to talk to people so it is something that is perfect for me. The homes I would like to sell are multi million dollar homes as those are the ones that I love to look at. Maybe one day I would be able to live in one of those myself in the future. Overall, I hope to receive all the goals I have in my life as they do not seem too hard to get to. My drive to do all of this is to make my parents happy as they made me happy as a child so I must pay them back in the future. Otherwise, I would feel as if I wasted all their efforts that they put into me so that I can become successful. Although school is very hard, I will persevere through all of it and become educated so that I can do all of things that I wish to. Then I will be able have everything I want because I do not want as much as some other people. I just want to be successful with a good time and talk to others as talking to people is really fun.  My life will be a good time and I will do whatever I can to make it like that.
